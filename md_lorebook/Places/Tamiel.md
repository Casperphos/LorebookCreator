# Tamiel, Human Capital

Tamiel is the jewel amidst the Human Kingdom's Crown - the very heartbeat of human civilization. Underneath the watchful gaze of Kings, Queens, and the City's Council, this **capital** has flourished into a place that rivals even dreams with its prosperity.

Let not this golden image deceive your discerning eyes, for perfection hides in shadows cast by flickering torches. In the depths of poorer districts, fear whisper on twilight breezes - when evening descends upon these cobblestoned streets, it is prudent to avoid wandering alone.

No place can truly boast absolute perfection - such is nature's balance we struggle against.
