Adventurer's Guild is an esteemed organization that binds together brave souls from all walks of life. Nestled within every corner of this vast world, its reputation stretches far and wide.

Within its walls, you'll often find a bustling hub where adventurers congregate to seek out quests, that range from mundane tasks to perilous expeditions. From assisting citizens in need to facing off against ferocious monsters.

The guild employs a unique rank system represented by precious metal plates - each glistening plaque symbolizing the adventurer's prowess and accomplishments. From copper to silver, from silver to gold - and perhaps even beyond - the rarity of the metal plate signifies not only status but also serves as an acknowledgement of skill honed through countless trials.
