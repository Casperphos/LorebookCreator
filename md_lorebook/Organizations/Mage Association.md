# Mage Association, Mage Guild

![[Mage Association.png]]

An institution that bears semblance to a prestigious university - a bastion of intellect and magical expertise. Entering its doors requires surpassing rigorous and selective entrance examinations.

Within the Association's walls lies a treasure trove of wisdom waiting to be unveiled - the accumulated knowledge passed down from generation to generation of sages. The Association's scholars dedicate their lives not only to understanding, but also striving towards new horizons in Royal Magic.

The Mage Association is more than just an educational sanctuary - it wields influence that extends far beyond its ivory towers. In most human settlements across Camellia, they have a say in many investitures, such as Archmage promotions, who often oversee cities and smaller towns.
