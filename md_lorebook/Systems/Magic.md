# Magic, Magick

In the realm of Camellia, magic is not merely an ephemeral concept, but a tangible force woven into the very fabric of reality. Mana, the earthly energy that flows through all living and non-living beings alike, serves as the conduit for those who seek to wield magic.

## Origin of Magic, Void Magic

At its core, all magic in Camellia traces its origin back to Void Magic - a primordial power that splits into two distinct branches: Light and Dark. While manipulation of Void Magic itself remains mostly theoretical, some extraordinary individuals from time immemorial have defied convention by tapping into its immense potential.

## Light Magic, Dark Magic

Light Magic and Dark Magic require a special affinity from their practitioners. Although Light Magic prevails as widely accepted due to its benevolent nature, Dark Magic finds itself shrouded in controversy and often frowned upon in most realms across Camellia. It is widely known that Light Magic cannot exist without its counterpart, but people still hold an unfounded grudge towards it, especially after the God of Dusk and Dawn has absolved all human races from most of their Dark Energy.

## Royal Magic, Blue Magic

Royal Magic, often known as Blue Magic due to its distinctive azure hue, is a manifestation of refined artistry that draws upon Void Magic and harnesses the purity of Light Magic. Once shrouded in exclusivity within royal circles, these spells have now found their way into human schools, where eager minds delve into their intricate secrets.

Within the realm of Royal Magic, different schools have emerged, each focusing on specific aspects of mastery over reality.

### Alteration School, Alteration Magic

Masters of Alteration wield their expertise to manipulate the very fabric of the physical realm. They possess an uncanny aptitude for shaping objects and protecting against other forms of magic. Legends speak of awe-inspiring feats such as walking atop water or levitating through sheer focus - an irrefutable testament to Alteration's profound influence.

### Enhancement School, Enhancement Magic

This school delves into spells that augment the very essence of one's being, whether for noble or nefarious purposes. Among the royally affiliated Knights, enhancing combat capabilities such as speed, reflexes, and strength has long been a popular pursuit.

However, it is worth noting that many tournaments have stipulations prohibiting the use of Enhancement magic due to its propensity for creating imbalances between contestants. The desire for fair competition often supersedes even the allure of augmented abilities.

### Illusion School, Illusion Magic

Illusionists entrancingly tinker with perceptual boundaries by delving into realms beyond mere sight. With their formidable skills at hand, they obscure truths, sow confusion within unsuspecting minds, silence voices at will, and even command people under the guise of ethereal manipulation. Among their legendary accomplishments is the fabled ability to render oneself invisible - a captivating demonstration indeed.

### Dimension School, Dimension Magic

Dimensional experts hold dominion over secret dimensions woven beyond conventional reality's grasp. By harnessing this esoteric power, they create pocket realms capable of storing items or even bending natural laws themselves. The pinnacle achievement among them is unquestionably teleportation - an extraordinary feat bestowing unrivalled freedom.

### Sexual School, Sexual Magic

As energy in the world of Camellia can be harnessed and moulded for any possible use, it is no surprise that magic specialized in bringing oneself pleasure has emerged. The Sexual School of Royal magic is seldom talked about, but as of recently its scholars have concerned themselves about creating Sexual Spells, that are more accessible to the public. The most well known spell from this school is of course the Birth Control Spell, allowing raw intercourse. Other variant spells are used for dealing with sexually transmitted diseases, or rather protecting against them, and heightening one's senses to give way for far greater pleasure.

## Hexes, Hex, Forbidden Magic, Purple Magic

The forbidden enigma within the world of magic. Born from the fusion of Void Magic and Dark Magic, they stand as a representation of uncharted depths and hidden potential. In both theory and practice, Hexes possess the ability to mimic the very same functions found within Royal Magic.

Held in contempt by society at large, it is believed that Hexes hold the potential to corrupt and destroy everything found in their wake.

Over time, only one school that managed to survive in the human world, amidst this sea of disdain, is Conjuration or Necromancy - an art steeped in mystery and whispered tales.

Although Hex wielders are considered to be an extinct breed in the human world, many schools of this type of magic have emerged in the Demon Realm.

### Succubi School, Succubi Magic

One of the most prominent and well known School of Hexes, amidst the human race. This School of Demon Magic can be likened to an amalgamation of the Royal School of Illusion and Sexual Magic. Spells created by the Succubi serve boil down to one simple purpose - to deceive heedless humans and drain them of their precious life-giving energy, with mind-shattering pleasure. A popular spell studied once by the humans was told to increase sexual potency and fertility in both human males and females.

## Deep Magic, Dark Blue Magic

A hidden enigma, shrouded in secrecy and whispered only in hushed tones among the ancients. Born from an extraordinary fusion between Royal Magic and Hexes, this esoteric form of magic remains unknown to even the wisest elders who have dedicated their lives to its study.

Characterized by its deep, dark blue hue that mirrors the midnight sky, Deep Magic houses forbidden spells of immense destructive power - able to rend even gods asunder. The delicate alliance between Royal Magic and Hexes grants practitioners unfettered access to manipulating Mana Energy itself, empowering them to infuse their custom-crafted spells with infinite might.

## Elemental Magic, Natural Magic

Delving deeper into elemental manipulation, mages channel both Light and Dark magic to command fire, water, wind, ice, lightning, and earth. While Light magic offers mastery over control and creation of Elemental Energy itself, Dark magic imbues it with potent might.

Though blessed with an innate proficiency in harnessing elemental forces, the people remain blissfully ignorant of their connection to Dark Magic - the forbidden strand that intertwines with their spells. Masked by societal disapproval, this clandestine knowledge evades even the most knowledgeable teachers, who dare not pass it on.

## Magic Affinity, Use of Magic, Practice of Magic

The people of Camellia are born with affinities towards specific types of magic; however, diligent training grants one access to harnessing and mastering other forms aside from these innate abilities. Yet there exist complex classifications such as Royal Spells or enigmatic Hexes that extend beyond traditional elemental boundaries.
