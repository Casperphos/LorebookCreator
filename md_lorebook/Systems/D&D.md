# D&D Rules, Dice Rolls

This little document explains how die rolls in this story work. This is a custom implementation of D&D dice. You preferably need a D100 die.

Let's see how the system works on an example.

This is Eden's ability Power Sheet:

```
Melee Power: 20 + 2
Fire Magic Power: 15 + 1
Enhacement School Magic Power: 15
```

Eden has base stats for her abilities and small bonuses, that represent her growth as a character or equipment bonuses.

Eden wants to deliver a strike to a Skeleton monster, so we take her melee power (20 + 2 = 22) into consideration. You roll the D100 **twice**, and take whatever outcome you consider more advantageous:

```
0-11: Eden delivers a masterful strike.
12-22: Eden delivers a precise strike.
23-44: Eden manages to hit the monster.
45-66: Eden misses her strike.
>66: Eden misses her strike, and is thrown out of balance.
```

I will do 2 D100 rolls now to present this system:

1. I roll 63, 36.
2. 36 represents a better outcome.
3. 36 is within this range 23-44.
4. Eden manages to hit the monster.

Combat checks are based on the power stats, and all other checks are based on the character's stats.

Baseline for a stat/power stat is 10, which guarantees a 20%, chance of success, but remember that you normally roll 2 times, so this chance is much higher.

If an activity is easy, you may roll your die 1 additional time (3 times in total), if an activity is hard, you may roll your die only 1 time.
