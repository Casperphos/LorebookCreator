# Deviant's Staff, Pervert's Staff

```
An infamous Magical Staff imbued with the essence of Debauchery. Its shaft, made from Ashwood, envelops a bloodstone at the staff's head in natural, smooth shapes. Moderately increases user's intelligence and all Elemental Magic proficiency:

+2 Intelligence
+5 All Elemental Magic 

Turns all 1D100 Sexual Magic rolls into 2D100 rolls, all 2D100 rolls into 3D100 rolls, and all 3D100 rolls into an instant success, while granting great affinity with Sexual School Magic:
