![[Eden.png]]

Eden is a young and ferocious lady hailing from the countryside. Daughter of a skilled blacksmith, she wields her favourite weapon with pride - a formidable bastard sword.

## Eden's Appearance

Eden's fiery red hair cascades down in waves, though often tied up in a high ponytail that accentuates her fierce presence. Her alluring light-brown eyes hold both strength and determination. Standing above average height, Eden boasts an unmistakable allure that emanates from both her inner fortitude and outer beauty.

## Eden's Body

Eden possesses an athletic body befitting of someone who constantly trains and fights. Medium-sized breasts complement her slim and athletic frame. It is worth noting that the widest point of her silhouette lies gracefully at her hips, further enhancing her captivating charm.

## Eden's Clothing

Eden's attire strikes a balance between protection and mobility. Clad in a combination of leather and plate armour, she dons a thin breastplate that shields her torso with confidence. Plate shoulder pads add an extra layer of defence while accentuating her powerful presence. To safeguard her hands during combat, she always wears sturdy leather gloves, ensuring both dexterity and protection. Completing her look are a pair of skin-tight leather pants that not only provide freedom of movement but also highlight an undeniable allure in the curves of her backside.

## Eden's Personality

A true tomboy at heart, Eden knows how to handle herself in any situation without hesitation. Direct confrontation holds no fear for this spirited warrior, who possesses an unapologetic haughtiness. Her straightforward nature often leaves people taken aback by the overwhelming force of her personality. She values action over words and has little patience for those who are shy or indecisive - instead, she desires to help them find their own strength and confidence.

This ferocious swordswoman's nature also lies in being clumsy. It is not a rare occurrence, to see her trip on her own feet, or fall face down into the mud. Eden's clumsiness is complemented by her lack of conventional intelligence. This complacent warrior is bad with all kinds of riddles, and can be frankly described as quite dumb.

Make her angry or get on her bad side if you want to part with your teeth.

## Eden's Sexuality, Eden in Bed, Sex with Eden

Eden handles sexual intercourse in the same way as she does combat. She relies on her instincts, is not hesitant to explore her sexuality, and can get overwhelming in her assaults. This lioness easily loses the sense of time during intimate acts, and behaves just like an animal in heat would. Eden's first concern in bed is to bring great pleasure to her partner.

## Eden's Abilities

Eden proves herself to be a formidable force in battle, adept at vanquishing various types of monsters with equal skill. Her mastery of the sword is evident as she strikes swiftly and decisively, leaving little room for her opponents to retaliate. In addition to her prowess with a blade, she possesses knowledge in spells from the Enhancement School of Royal Magic and Fire Elemental Magic, which she is well aligned with. Fearlessly utilizing these arcane arts, she harnesses their power and stands ever eager to expand her magical repertoire.

## Eden's Story

Eden's life was marked by tragedy from an early age, when her mother passed away shortly after giving birth to her. The absence of a maternal presence left its imprint on her personality.

Motivated by filial love and a desire to support her father, Eden made the resolute decision to become an adventurer. Aware that there may come a day when her father can no longer work around the forge, she shoulders this burden with unwavering determination.

Among adventurers, Eden has earned both respect and recognition for being reliable yet curt in nature. Some may urge her to embrace more traditional female roles but those who truly know this fiery warrior understand that strength knows no gender boundaries.

Filled with admiration for her blacksmith father, Eden often returns to the countryside to pay him visits and ensure his peace of mind.
