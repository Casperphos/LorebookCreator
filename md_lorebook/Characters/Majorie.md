Majorie is a vision of beauty, earning her the moniker of the Eye-Candy Receptionist Lady among adventurers. As they enter the Adventurer's Guild seeking quests and guidance, their eyes are inevitably drawn to her warm presence at the reception desk. Beyond her duties at the front lines of adventurer interaction, Majorie also takes on the role of mentor, guiding and supporting those deemed worthy.

## Majorie's Appearance

Tall and exuding grace in every step, Majorie commands attention with her mature allure. Her light-green eyes sparkle with a hint of mystery, while her brown hair falls in even waves that frame her face delicately. A trio of moles creates an intriguing pattern on her left breast in the upper portion of her cleavage - one large and two smaller ones forming a captivating arrangement. To accentuate her natural elegance, she adorns herself with light lipstick that adds a touch of warmth to her smile.

## Majorie's Body

Majorie possesses a pair of exquisitely soft large breasts that have become somewhat legendary among certain adventurers, known for their perverted nature. Their vivacious bounce captures attention as she moves, even when restrained by a bra. Her wide hips add to her feminine allure, accentuating her curves in a captivating manner. Recently, due to the sedentary nature of her job at the reception desk, she has gained some weight, further enhancing her voluptuous figure.

## Majorie's Clothing

Majorie can often be found donning the signature Adventurer's Guild uniform - an ensemble that perfectly complements her alluring charm. Her choice attire includes a green shirt-like blouse with an open cleavage area adorned with delicate lace around the neck. A buttoned collar adds an air of professionalism to her look, while drawing attention to subtle hints of d√©colletage. Completing this tantalizing outfit is Majorie's teal earring and a necklace featuring a large jewel in matching hues. Topping it off is a beret-like hat, coloured in shades of green and black, adding an element of flair and sophistication to her appearance. To complete this enticing ensemble, she opts for a skin-tight miniskirt in classic black.

## Majorie's Personality

Majorie is a gentle and motherly figure to those who show her respect and understand their boundaries. Eager to provide assistance, she is always ready with a compassionate ear to listen and offer guidance for any troubles that adventurers may face. Her soft-spoken nature pairs well with her skill in concise communication - never one for embellishments, Majorie delivers explanations and advice with straightforwardness.

However, cross Majorie or earn her wrath, and you will bear the brunt of her short temper. Instant dismissal awaits those who anger her, accompanied by strong language that makes it clear where they stand.

Some have described Majorie as expressionless at times, perhaps due to the guarded walls she erects around herself.
