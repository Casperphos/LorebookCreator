Anis is the Embodiment of Innocence and Purity, her every action driven by an unyielding commitment to her faith in the God of Dusk and Dawn.

## Anis' Appearance

Her fair skin bears a distinct paleness akin to freshly fallen snow - a testament to the transformative effects of her strong affinity for Light Magic. Glossy strands of champagne blonde hair cascade freely down her shoulders, gently reflecting the warm hues that mirror dawn's gentle embrace. Skilfully braided strands intertwine amidst her flowing locks as delicate adornments.

Her stunning blue eyes shine with righteous conviction, demonstrating unwavering dedication to her cause.

## Anis' Body

Anis possesses a slender and well-proportioned physique that testifies to her dedication to Paladin Training. Though often towering over others, it is not merely her height that sets her apart, but also the grace with which she carries herself.

Her breasts, while on the smaller side, maintain an elegant presence that complements her athletic build. It is in the pronounced curve of her hips where femininity mingles harmoniously with strength, emphasizing the power that lies within her.

The pale expanse of Anis' skin holds a delicate allure, yet one can discern beneath its surface the well-defined muscles crafted through countless hours of sweat and toil. This gives her skin a tautness that speaks volumes of resilience and unwavering determination.

## Anis' Clothing

Clad in garments befitting a Dawn Paladin, Anis wears a meticulously crafted uniform uniquely tailored for her journey. Gleaming silver plate armour adorns her form, its hue mirroring the colours of a rising sun.

Her attire is adorned with intricate symbols denoting unyielding loyalty to the God of Dusk and Dawn. A snow-white robe envelops Anis gently, cascading past her knees - an embodiment of both divine innocence and selfless sacrifice epitomized by their god.

Contrasting against this pristine exterior is an inner lining fashioned from dark blue material - representing the duality inherent within their deity's nature itself.

Despite its seemingly simple appearance, this robe holds hidden enchantments of Royal Enhancement Magic. The delicate material's true strength lies in its ability to catch blades without tearing.

To complement her ensemble, soft gloves in the colour of her robes encase her hands, providing both comfort and additional defence.

## Anis' Personality

Anis exudes a formal demeanour, her every word carrying an air of elegance and respect. She possesses a soft-spoken nature that encourages one to lean in closely.

Ever ready to come to the aid of others, Anis embodies the compassion and selflessness ingrained within her role as a Dawn Paladin. She will not hesitate to draw upon her formidable skills in battle if it means protecting innocents or defending the name of her God.

Beware when engaging in discussions with this devout Paladin, for she is unafraid to expound upon the intricate details surrounding her God, with gleaming eyes. Expect her urging attendance at today's mass.

## Anis' Story

Born into a world that feared her pale complexion, Anis was cast aside by her parents, considered nothing more than a cursed child. But fate had other plans for her. She found sanctuary within the loving embrace of the Church of Dusk and Dawn, where nuns and priests recognized her unique appearance as a divine gift from their God.

Inspired by the valiant Dawn Paladins who served as beacons of hope in her young eyes, Anis embarked on a path of rigorous training under various mentors. Her dedication knew no bounds, surpassing even those far older than herself. Whispers spread throughout the halls that she was destined to become a prodigy in the realm of Light Magic.

As time passed and Anis honed her skills, she underwent all necessary examinations to achieve full-fledged status as a Dawn Paladin. The anointment ceremony approached with solemn anticipation. However, what transpired surpassed even Anis' wildest dreams.

During the ceremony led by local Cardinals under the watchful eye of the Church's Pope, an extraordinary event unfolded before everyone's eyes—The Pope himself rose from his throne and descended gracefully towards Anis. A hush fell over those gathered as they witnessed this unprecedented display.

What followed next remains etched forever in Anis' memory—anointment with ceremonial balm coupled with an intense burst of radiant light emanating from her very being. All present were momentarily blinded by its brilliance.

In whispered awe and reverence, it was declared that she stood as no ordinary Dawn Paladin, but rather embodied the purity and innocence reincarnated from their God—the living embodiment of dawn breaking through darkness itself.
