Her dedication knew no bounds, surpassing even those far older than herself. Whispers spread throughout the halls that she was destined to become a prodigy in the realm of Light Magic.\nAs time passed and Anis honed her skills, she underwent all necessary examinations to achieve full-fledged status as a Dawn Paladin. The anointment ceremony approached with solemn anticipation. However, what transpired surpassed even Anis' wildest dreams.\nDuring the ceremony led by local Cardinals under the watchful eye of the Church's Pope, an extraordinary event unfolded before everyone's eyes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dThe Pope himself rose from his throne and descended gracefully towards Anis. A hush fell over those gathered as they witnessed this unprecedented display.\nWhat followed next remains etched forever in Anis' memory\u00e2\u20ac\u201danointment with ceremonial balm coupled with an intense burst of radiant light emanating from her very being.

You preferably need a D100 die.\nLet's see how the system works on an example.\nThis is Eden's ability Power Sheet:\n```\nMelee Power: 20 + 2\nFire Magic Power: 15 + 1\nEnhacement School Magic Power: 15\n```\nEden has base stats for her abilities and small bonuses, that represent her growth as a character or equipment bonuses.\nEden wants to deliver a strike to a Skeleton monster, so we take her melee power (20 + 2 = 22) into consideration. You roll the D100 **twice**, and take whatever outcome you consider more advantageous:\n```\n0-11: Eden delivers a masterful strike.\n12-22: Eden delivers a precise strike.\n23-44: Eden manages to hit the monster.\n45-66: Eden misses her strike.\n>66: Eden misses her strike, and is thrown out of balance.\n```\nI will do 2 D100 rolls now to present this system:\n1. I roll 63, 36.\n2. 36 represents a better outcome.\n3. 36 is within this range 23-44.\n4. Eden manages to hit the monster.\nCombat checks are based on the power stats, and all other checks are based on the character's stats.\nBaseline for a stat/power stat is 10, which guarantees a 20%, chance of success, but remember that you normally roll 2 times, so this chance is much higher.\nIf an activity is easy, you may roll your die 1 additional time (3 times in total), if an activity is hard, you may roll your die only 1 time.\nIf you have any doubts, refer to these graphs:\n![[non_failure_chance_plot_1_rolls.png]]\n![[non_failure_chance_plot_2_rolls.png]]\n![[non_failure_chance_plot_3_rolls.png]]\nDND Helper Sheet for 2 rolls:\n```\nBase Stat | Non-Failure Chance\n        1 |              7.84%\n        2 |             11.64%\n        3 |             15.36%\n        4 |             19.00%\n        5 |             22.56%\n        6 |             26.04%\n        7 |             29.44%\n        8 |             32.76%\n        9 |             36.00%\n       10 |             39.16%\n       11 |             42.24%\n       12 |             45.24%\n       13 |             48.16%\n       14 |             51.00%\n       15 |             53.76%\n       16 |             56.44%\n       17 |             59.04%\n       18 |             61.56%\n       19 |             64.00%\n       20 |             66.36%\n       21 |             68.64%\n       22 |             70.84%\n       23 |             72.96%\n       24 |             75.00%\n       25 |             76.96%\n       26 |             78.84%\n       27 |             80.64%\n       28 |             82.36%\n       29 |             84.00%\n       30 |             85.56%\n       31 |             87.04%\n       32 |             88.44%\n       33 |             89.76%\n       34 |             90.39%\n       35 |             91.59%\n       36 |             92.71%\n       37 |             93.75%\n       38 |             94.71%\n       39 |             95.59%\n       40 |             96.39%\n       41 |             97.11%\n       42 |             97.75%\n       43 |             98.31%\n       44 |             98.79%\n       45 |             99.19%\n       46 |             99.51%\n       47 |             99.75%\n       48 |             99.91%\n       49 |             99.99%\n       50 |            100.00%\n```\n",
